    "# Exploring how Lichess' players spend their playing time\n",
    "\n",
    "*Chess addiction has always been a popular topic, and although its formal existence should be examined through rigorous studies, it has made me curious about how players typically spend their time on Lichess.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was aggregated from the January 2023 Lichess rated games (freely available on the [Lichess database website](https://database.lichess.org)). Bots and games shorter than 4 plies were filtered out. For each account (which from now on will consider equivalent to user), I kept their username, as well as **for each time control** (TC for short, also sometimes referred as category):\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Their number of games\n",
    "*   Their average rating over the month\n",
    "*   The \"Estimated time spent\", which is the total time they spent playing this TC, with each game duration computed only using the clocks configuration, [using Lichess' formula](https://lichess.org/faq#time-controls) to differenciate between blitz/bullet/etc: (**clock initial time in seconds) + 40 Ã— (clock increment)**.\n",
    "*   The \"Real time spent\",  which is the total time they spent playing this TC, based on the time left on the clock at the end of the game, and taking into account increment and berserk. Apart from obvious cases, it does not take into account the use of the `+15s` button, which was considered negligible."
