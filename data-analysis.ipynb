    "# Exploring how Lichess' players spend their playing time\n",
    "\n",
    "*Chess addiction has always been a recurring subject online, and while its formal existence should be left to rigourous studies, it has lead me to wonder more generally about how players spent their time playing on Lichess, which is the topic I will delve into today.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was aggregated from the January 2023 Lichess rated games (freely available on the [Lichess database website](https://database.lichess.org)). Bots and games shorter than 4 plies were filtered out. For each account (which from now on I will consider equivalent to one user), I kept their their username, as well as for each time control (TC):\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Their number of games\n",
    "*   Their average rating over the month\n",
    "*   The \"Estimated time spent\", which is the total time they spent playing this TC, with each game duration computed from the starting clock and increment, [using Lichess' formula](https://lichess.org/faq#time-controls) to differenciate between blitz/bullet/etc: (**clock initial time in seconds) + 40 Ã— (clock increment)**.\n",
    "*   The \"Real time spent\",  which is the total time they spent playing this TC, based on the time left on the clock at the end of the game, and taking into account increment of course. It does not take into account the use of the `+15s` button, which was considered negligible."
